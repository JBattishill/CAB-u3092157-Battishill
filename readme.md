# Static Site Generator
**u3092157 - Jarryd Battishill**

I chose to build my website as a portfolio for my design business.

## Demographic:
**age -** 16+
**income level -** All income levels, due to affordable pricing.
**cultural background -** all cultures
**employment -** Public servants because Canberra, but could  be anything.
**location -** Canberrans, but also anyone from across Australia or even international - gotta dream big.
**level of education -** All levels

## Goals

• A simple, clean website that's easy to navigate and understand
• Fun, creative and reflective of my personality
• Responsive

## Inspiration

I honestly didn't take much inspiration from anywhere except the 11ty/Tailwind template I used - https://jamstackthemes.dev/theme/11ty-landing-page/

## Planning

I decided to combine some pages from the original contour 556 websites. I felt there were too many and it made it cluttered and messy.

I also decided not to include all the images (and required pages) of previous artists’ as I honestly just didn't have the time.

I feel I was able to present a solid website without that information.

## Production Process

I started by trying to flesh out the Index page, using nested grids and flexboxes, once I had a pretty good foundation, I showed my site to Ben in class on 12 April. He mentioned it looked good but was worried about the nested grids not being industry standard and potentially unstable. He recommended I have a look into using the CSS Grid Area function and showed me the CSS Tips and Tricks Page.

On Wednesday 13 of April, I realised I’d been committing changes to my GitHub but not actually pushing them to the origin file. Luckily this caused no issues, but it was a good lesson to learn earlier than later.

I started working with the Grid Area function but honestly struggled a little at the beginning, especially with centring items, the reviewer of my code may find 1 or 2, maybe 5, not properly centred items.

## Advanced Code
Some of the more advanced functionality I tried to implement include:

**Favicon!**
Not *really* advanced functionality, but I always love a good favicon. I opened Illustrator and grabbed the C icon from the contour website and used image trace to create the path as an SVG and changed the colour to the red used on the site.

**Index Page**
• Rotating Text that uses text hidden by **overflow: hidden** and animation/keyframes to move the hidden text into the viewable area.
• The background of this box is a gradient that moves and changes colour. It does this after a delay to make it a surprise.
• JavaScript carousel of art from previous festivals.

**All Pages**

• Navbar, on hover, an underline bar grows from the left of the box that is being hovered.

• Logo, on hover the logo changes from black to the red colour used on the site and slides to the right.

• When the media screen is 650px or less, the logo swaps to the square C icon logo, there are also changes to various text sizes to help them stay legible.

**Lessons learned**

As I often struggle with thanks to my neurodiversity, time management was a struggle for me.

I didn't get to do as much as I wanted to do with the site. I hoped to do more fine-tuning with row heights to get more conformity and I wanted to spend more time testing font sizes etc.

However, overall, I am really proud of the work that I am submitting, next time I might try to sort my coding into MVP and Shiney extras because I spent too long on Shiney extras at the beginning.
