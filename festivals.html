                <h4>1 - 29 OCTOBER 2022</h4>
                <h2> transformed for 2022 with 3 new locations </h2>            
            <p class="textbox">
                The 2022 edition sees the festival rebranded as Canberra Art Biennial, and sees expansion to the National Arboretum (contour 656), the University of Canberra (contour 606) as well as maintaining and building further on our presence in North and South Canberra, centred on contour 556, the height abotiove sea level of Lake Burley Griffin.  
            </p>
            <p class="textbox redbg">
                Canberra Art Biennial extends across Canberra's public spaces, and we are excited to partner with more  private and public gallery / cultural spaces in inner north and south Canberra. 
           </p>    
            <p class="textbox">
                Neil Hobbs is the creative director for the contour 556 and contour 656 areas, with support from Heeseon Jung and the contour 556 board. The contour 606 satellite event will be co-curated by University of Canberra staff members Associate Professor Julian Raxworthy, discipline lead of the landscape architecture program and Ben Ennis-Butler, senior lecturer and Program Core Coordinator, Design.              
            </p> 
            <p class="textbox">
                University of Canberra joins us as a major sponsor and supporter - The Faculty of Arts and Design students have revisited our logo and graphic branding, and we are delighted to have Julian and Ben contribute to the event.            
            </p> 
            <p class="textbox redbg">
                Artists will be responding  to the designed city of Canberra: represented by Australia’s political, cultural and physical history. The event engages people of all ages and abilities, delighting, puzzling and encouraging interaction with art and public space. 
            </p>
